The methods are as follows\n- Emailing: 7465 customers, totaling 716k in revenue. It requires little work.  \n- Emailing them and then follow up call:572 customers,totaling 457k in revenue. \n- Long phone call:4961 customers, totaling 241k in revenue. It requires a lot of work work.  \nRefer to figure 1 and 2 bellow for a visual representation of revenue vs. contact method and customer count vs. contact method.   \n\n![Figure 1 Revenue vs Contact Method](Figure%201%20Revenue%20vs%20Contact%20Method.jpg)\n![Figure 2 Number of Customers in Each Sales Group](Figure%202%20Number%20of%20Customers%20in%20Each%20Sales%20Group.jpg)\n","metadata":{},"id":"79276988-f501-40d7-950a-877b80aa86f4","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## The Distribution of Revenu\nBased on Figure 3's box plot, the revenue per order has an interquartile range of approximately 50 to 110. The upper whisker displays greater variability than the lower whisker, and several outliers exist on the higher end of the revenue range. Figure 4 shows the revenue distribution separated by sales method. The \"email+call\" category exhibits higher revenue values than the \"email\" category, which, in turn, surpasses the \"call\" category. The majority of low revenue sales originate from the \"call\" group, while the \"email+call\" group generates the majority of high revenue sales.\n\n![Figure 3 Distribution of Revenue](Figure%203%20Distribution%20of%20Revenue.jpg)\n![Figure 4 Distribution of Revenue by Sales Method](Figure%204%20Distribution%20of%20Revenue%20by%20Sales%20Method.jpg)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f9147e0c-b5fb-412e-8a59-0a1f1bc441b9"},{"source":"## How do the Different Customer Groups Differ?\nBefore determining the best contact method, it is important to understand our customers and if there are differences between the groups. We found that the top five states with the most customers are California,Texas,New York State, Florida and Illinois,hich together generated $516k in revenue(figure 5).\nLooking at years customers have been with us 60% we see a large spike at 1 year and then a sharp decline.

This aligns with Figure 2 showing that this group had the most customers.\n\nFigure 9 shoes that for the 'email' group, as well as in general, orders of 9, 10, and 11 brought in the highest revenue. However, for orders of 12 items or more, the 'email' group's revenue decreased, and it was replaced by the 'email + call' group.\n\nFigure 10 shows an overall upward trend, indicating that orders with a greater number of products generated higher revenue. On average, customers in the 'email+call' group spent more per order than the other groups.

There is then a decrease in revenue for this method until week 4, when it shows another minor spike, which is consistent with the follow-up email sent at that time.\n\nIn contrast, revenue from customers in the 'call' group remained consistently low, without much of a discernible pattern. Although it is known that these calls took approximately 30 minutes per customer, it is unclear whether they were all completed in one week or spaced out.\n\nCustomers in the 'email and call' group were sent an email at launch, followed by a phone call a week later. It is logical that revenue was initially low in the first week because there was insufficient time for the follow-up email. This method's revenue then steadily increased over the first five weeks as customers received their email, had time to think, and then received a phone call. In weeks 5 and 6, more sales were generated from this group than any other.\n\n![Figure 11 Total Revenue by Week for Each Contact Methods](Figure%2011%20Total%20Revenue%20by%20Week%20for%20Each%20Contact%20Methods.jpg)\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"bc95b12f-bd6f-4304-9e47-e1f93f7b5240","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"","metadata":{},"id":"029bbe58-f1f2-46b1-a58b-e3f52a1187b1","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"","metadata":{},"id":"a04ae5d8-a41e-4972-b625-502eb45fd35b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Hybrid Approach","metadata":{},"id":"27b410ee-9fb8-4cd3-8649-39ef4b6b5e2b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"After completing my analysis I would my recommend  adopting a hybrid approach to marketing. \nBased on my analysis, the 'email' group generated the highest overall spending.
